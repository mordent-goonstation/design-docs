# Robotics Features

## Overview

This is a living design document that is intended to assist with development of a new featureset primarily for Roboticists to interact with.

The document includes the initial design, and as the concrete implementation is fleshed out it may be included for the sake of clarifying thoughts and aiding in the development process.

This is *not* a standard design document that is intended to live standalone to the feature being developed; it is not a standard to measure the feature against, but a place to help organize it.

## Goals

1. Add a meaningful feature for Roboticists to work on in a round to enhance cyborgs.
2. Provide design-space for niche or bespoke tools that would otherwise bloat a (current implementation) cyborg module loadout if they were always included.
3. Provide design-space for balancing more powerful tools being part of a (current implementation) cyborg module.
4. Give Roboticists a feature space to explore, with trade-offs (cost, time to acquire, rarity) that reward knowledge of the system.

## Non-Goals

1. Make roundstart/early round cyborgs unable to assist with or complete fundamental parts of their specialized role.
2. Require interaction with the improvement system in order for cyborgs to meaningfully contribute to a round.
3. Require cyborgs be present/engaged for the Roboticist to make some use of the feature.
4. Allow cyborgs to do the task themselves.
